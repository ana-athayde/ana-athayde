### About me

My interest in programming started with a computer technician course during high school, where I had the opportunity to become a tutor and participate in some research projects. In the second semester of 2020, I started a degree in Computer Science course at Udesc - Joinville. Currently, I am a scholarship student in the Computational Intelligence Research Laboratory (LABCOM) at UDESC in the multiobjective optimization project of the stamping process of an automotive part in partnership with ArcelorMittal from Brasil.
