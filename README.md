### About me


Hello, I'm Ana Athayde,a Computer Scientist student. My interest in programming started with a computer technician course during high school, where I had the opportunity to become a tutor and participate in some research projects.

Now, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at UDESC, I'm again falling in love with programming.

In the first semester of 2020, I became a Research Assistant at LABCOM, UDESC. Here, I had the chance to dive into multi-objective optimization projects and collaborate with industry experts. One of the highlights was the publication of "Automotive Stamping Process Optimization Using Machine Learning and Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm,".

I also dedicated time as a Project Volunteer at Ação Maratonas de Programação. It was here that I developed my problem-solving skills, trained others, and promoted teamwork.
