### About me

My Journey in the World of Tech and Problem Solving:

Hello, I'm Ana Athayde, a dedicated Computer Scientist deeply devoted to problem-solving. My interest in programming started with a computer technician course during high school, where I had the opportunity to become a tutor and participate in some research projects. This phase opened doors to new opportunities and experiences.

Now, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at UDESC, I'm falling in love with programming. Languages like C++, Python, and Haskell are evolving into creative playgrounds.

In the first semester of 2020, I became a Research Assistant at LABCOM, UDESC. Here, I had the chance to dive deep into multi-objective optimization projects and collaborate with industry experts. One of the highlights of this journey was the publication of "Automotive Stamping Process Optimization Using Machine Learning and Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm," a project that remains close to my heart.

I also dedicated time as a Project Volunteer at Ação Maratonas de Programação. It was here that I sharpened my problem-solving skills, trained others, and promoted a sense of teamwork among fellow enthusiasts. I'm proud of my accomplishments, from 15th Place in the 1st Southern Programming Marathon 2021 to securing 7th Place in the ICPC Santa Catarina Sub-Regional 2021.

Beyond coding, I embraced languages in the true sense. I'm fluent in Portuguese, advanced in English, and have an intermediate grasp of German, reflecting my international perspective.

I believe in lifelong learning, and I'm always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge. Learning new languages and exploring technological innovation are some of my passions.

My journey is a testament to dedication, innovation, and the limitless possibilities in Computer Science. I hope my story inspires you in this exciting field.
